## Notes

The challenge was trying to make the map search functionality. I first converted the activity_main.xml into a LinearLayout, and
followed the steps as shown in the walkthrough. However, the different programming languages (Java vs Kotlin) caused a few syntax
issues that I could not figure out, so I commented all the code (for you to review) and settled with the color customization extension.
